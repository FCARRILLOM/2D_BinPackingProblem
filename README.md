# 2D_BinPackingProblem
Final project for Computer Intelligence course at ITESM Aug-Dec 2020

For this project I had to solve the Bin Packing Problem in 2D using any optimization algorithm learned during the course.

To solve this problem I chose to create a genetic algorithm using the evolutionary algorithms framework 'DEAP'.
